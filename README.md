SVM model to perform face recognition. This model uses opencv obtain features from images.The model takes inputs by converting the images into b64 format.
I am trying to improve this model further. This project is inspired from codebasics channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWXXHjV3JHI&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uvaRHZLl-jLovIjBP14QTXc.
